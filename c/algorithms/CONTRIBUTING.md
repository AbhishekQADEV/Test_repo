# Contributing guidelines
## Contributing Rules:
### Rule 1: Issues must detail what exactly is the problem
### Rule 2: Code must be clean, meaning no excessive use of comments, and please don't make walls of code.
### Rule 3: All algorithms must be programmed in C.

## Contributing Advice:
### The more helpful an issue is, the more likely it will be fixed
### Test your code before running it
### While indentation is good, using too much is hard to read.

// Remove unused imports
// Use Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures: Optimize your code logic and data handling.
// Sometimes, a more efficient algorithm or data structure can significantly reduce execution time and memory usage.
// Improve any coding logic for performance and use the following packages for that:

// Parallelize Operations When possible, parallelize independent asynchronous operations to reduce overall execution time.
// Use Promise.all to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.

// Code improvements and optimizations can be made here.
