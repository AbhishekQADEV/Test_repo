# algorithms
A open source repository of different kinds of algorithms in c. Newbies are encouraged to contribute!
This is my first open source project, so i am open to criticisms, bugs, and ideas.

## Linux:
### To compile  (with a makefile)
`make`
### To compile (without a makefile)
`gcc -o whatever-file`

## Improvements:
1. Parallelize independent asynchronous operations using Promise.all.
2. Remove unused imports.
3. Optimize code logic and data handling using efficient algorithms and data structures.

## Packages to use for performance optimization:
- package1
- package2
- package3

Please provide the code that needs to be improved for performance optimization.
