`make`
### To compile (without a makefile)

// Parallelize Operations
// Use Promise.all to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently

// Remove unused imports

// Use Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures

// Improve coding logic for performance

// Use the following packages for performance optimization:
// - package1
// - package2
// - package3
